# ESPHome-Components

The preferred method to add your own components to ESPHome is to use [External Components](https://esphome.io/components/external_components.html#external-components-git).


If you want to make all components available use this config.
```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/mikelawrence/esphome-components
```
If you want to make specific components available use this config.
```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/mikelawrence/esphome-components
    components: [ tfmini ]
```

## ESPHome TFMini External Component

These ToF (time of flight) range finder sensors are compact, self-contained range finders. They support both UART and I<sub>2</sub>C communication but this component only supports UART communication.

This component supports the following Benewake LiDAR Range Finder Sensors.

## Configuration Variables
+ **model** (**Required**, string): The model of the Range Finder Sensor. Options are ```TFMINI_PLUS```, ```TFMINI_S``` or ```TF_LUNA```.
+ **uart_id** (*Optional*, string): Manually specify the ID of the [UART Bus](https://esphome.io/components/uart) if you use multiple UART buses.
+ **sample_rate** (*Optional*, integer): The frame rate at which the sensor will output sensor data in samples per sec. For the TFMINI_PLUS and TFMINI_S the range is 1-1000. For the TFLuna the range is 1-500. Note when low_power mode is set to true for the TFMINI_S and the TFLuna model the is significantly lower from 1-10. Default is 100. 
+ **config_pin** (*Optional*, [Pin Schema](https://esphome.io/guides/configuration-types#config-pin-schema)): This pin when connected will be set high to enable UART mode. (*TF_LUNA only*) 
+ **low_power** (*Optional*, boolean): Turns on low power mode. This also requires sample_rate to be 10 or less. (*TF_LUNA, TFMini-S only*) 

## Sensors
+ **distance** (*Optional*): Distance in cm. For the TFMINI_PLUS and TFMINI_S the range is 10-1200cm. For the TFLuna the range is 20-800cm. A distance of 10000cm means the sensor is not receiving enough signal, most likely open air. A distance of 0cm means the sensor is saturated and there is no measurement possible. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).
+ **signal_strength** (*Optional*): Represents the signal strength with a range of 0-65535. The longer the measurement distance, the lower signal strength will be. The lower the reflectivity is, the lower the signal strength will be. When signal strength is less than 100 detection is unreliable and distance is set to 10000cm. When signal strength is 65535 detection is unreliable and distance is set to 0cm. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).
+ **temperature** (*Optional*): Internal temperature in Â°C. It's not clear how useful this sensor because it certainly does not measure room temperature. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).

## ESPHome STUSB4500 External Component

The STUSB4500 is a USB power delivery controller that supports sink up to 100 W (20V, 5A). It has Non-Volatile Memory that can be programmed with your PDO profile so when you connect to a USB-C Power Source it will immediately negotiate your power delivery contract.

</p>

There are 3 PDOs that you can configure with PD1 fixed at 5V. You can vary PD1's current. If you have all three PDOs configured the STUSB4500 will try to negotiate a contract with the PDOs in the following order: PD3, PD2 and PD1. If you don't want PDO1 negotiated then set ```power_only_above_5v: true```.

The configuration below the STUSB4500 will try to negotiate 12V @ 3A then 9V @ 3A. If neither are available then it won't negotiate at all.

+ **snk_uncons_power** (*Optional*, boolean): When set to ```true``` the STUSB4500 will tell the connected device external power is available. Default is ```false```.
+ **req_src_current** (*Optional*, boolean): When set to ```true``` the STUSB4500 will report the source current from source instead of the sink. Default is ```false```.
+ **power_ok_cfg** (*Optional*, boolean): Selects the POWER_OK pins configuration. Options are ```CONFIGURATION_1```, ```CONFIGURATION_2``` or ```CONFIGURATION_3```. Default is ```CONFIGURATION_2```.
+ **gpio_cfg** (*Optional*, boolean): Selects the GPIO configuration. Options are ```SW_CTRL_GPIO```, ```ERROR_RECOVERY```, ```DEBUG``` or ```SINK_POWER```. Default is ```ERROR_RECOVERY```.

## Sensors
+ **pd_state** (*Optional*): Current PD State as an integer. Range 0 to 3 where 0 is no PD negotiated. A value of 1, 2 or 3 indicates which PDO was negotiated. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).
+ **pd_status** (*Optional*): Easy to read PD State (e.g. "12V @ 3A" ). All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).

## Actions
When the GPIO is configured for software control ```gpio_cfg: SW_CTRL_GPIO ``` these actions control the state of the output. 

+ **stusb4500.turn_gpio_on** Will pull the GPIO low.
+ **stusb4500.turn_gpio_off** Will set the output to High-Z.

Example using automations...
```
on_value_range:
  - below: 5.0
    then:
      - stusb4500.turn_gpio_on: pd_controller
```
Example in lambdas...
```
- lambda: |-
  id(pd_controller).turn_gpio_on();
```

## NVM Configuration

> [!CAUTION]
> When configuring the STUSB4500 for the first time you should realize the default configuration will allow up to 20V on V<sub>BUS</sub>. Make sure your circuit can either support 20V or configure the NVM using a Power Source that will NOT produce 20V like USB 2.0 or a non-PD USB-C charger.

Using the STUSB4500 ESPHome component requires the following steps:

1. Set the configuration variables to match your requirements. The sample configuration above sets PDO3 to 12V @ 3A, PDO2 to 9V @3A and PDO1 is disabled because ```power_only_above_5v: true```. This means it will first try to negotiate 12V @ 3A. If unavailable then it will try 9V @ 3A. If is unavailable no PD will be negotiated. Either the ```pd_state``` or ```pd_status``` sensor will let you know if there is a problem.
2. Add ```flash_nvm: true``` to the configuration.
   You should see the following messages in your log.
     ```log
     [00:10:03][C][stusb4500:112]: STUSB4500:
     [00:10:03][E][stusb4500:119]:   NVM has been flashed, power cycle the device to reload NVM
     ```
   If you forgot to add ```flash_nvm: true``` to the configuration you will see an error in the log.
     ```log
     [00:06:27][C][stusb4500:112]: STUSB4500:
     [00:06:27][E][stusb4500:114]:   NVM does not match current settings, you should set flash_nvm: true for one boot
     [00:06:27][C][stusb4500:130]:   PDO3 negotiated 9.00V @ 3.00A, 27.00W
     ```
3. Power cycle your board. Make sure ```NVM matches settings``` is present in the log and that one of your PDOs was negotiated. Configuring the STUSB4500 can be a bit finicky, but keep at it.
   ```log
   [00:00:19][C][stusb4500:112]: STUSB4500:
   [00:00:19][C][stusb4500:116]:   NVM matches settings
   [00:00:19][C][stusb4500:130]:   PDO3 negotiated 12.00V @ 3.00A, 36.00W
   ```
4. The STUSB4500 comonent does check to see that the NVM is indeed different before flashing the NVM but it is prudent to remove the ```NVM matches settings``` after it is clear the STUSB4500 is worked as configured.
